Whistler 
==============

Whistler is a white listing markup filter based on the rails plugin by Rick Olson, aka technoweenie.

Whistler relies on the Hpricot library http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot
 
Whistler strips, and or sanitizes arbitrary XML/HTML style markup of any tags not explicitly
included in the white list.  It doesn't try to play catch-up with possible exploites such as black-listing systems do.

Usage is very simple.

=== Example
# Applies the normal white list defaults

Whistler.white_list( dodgy_markup ) 


# Adds custom tags to allow
Whistler.white_list(dodgy_markup, :add_tags => %w(news_tag my_tag other_tag))

If Whistler is unable to read tags as "tags" it will instead sanitize potential XSS attempts in the text.
Normal, non-malicious text should still appear correctly.
